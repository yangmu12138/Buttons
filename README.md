# Buttons--To make Robots got real sense

Buttons is a tool to help Robots understand the real world,it don't much rely on LLM ,but directly try to learn everything through Visual Status.


It is noteworthy that,How much the LLM can attend to the Status that aggregate sufficient information. As the description of the real world,Human Language more like a brief instruction. Although in some degree,Human Language loaded the Logic ability from Human Society,But no matter the amount of the Information about Logic or Itself,still can't  make the LLM know more clear about the real world and based on it to control the Robots. About Logic,i more wish to describe it as a process that use a series of Status to enwrap the problems and finally to rule out these uncertain elements,and this actually can be devided into 2 types. First,the ability to link different Status in order to cover the problem in special space. Second,while the linked Status can't solve the problem,it should automatically  expand the space and link more new Status to cover the problem.

Except visual information or waves,(of course,actually what we can see is still the Electromagnetic wave.)i think it's hard to find other kinds of mode to carry enough informations about the real world. If we can redesign the structure of the Computer,maybe the waves can be use as a greater loader of information,but until this second,a big model based on visual information still seems more close to make AGI come true. Actually, no matter Words,Voice or the process about how different force happens,all can be represent through visual mode. For one process about one thing,usually  we can use several kinds of Status to describe it,as to say these Status are paralleled.  So while Models try to learn about the real world through these Status,these different kinds of Status actually can help the model markedly promote the threshold about containing more information.

Another feature about visual status is that,actually we can make several images(of course we can call it a video) to share same size with one image. So compared with other type of information, visual Status really possess a big advantage. Of course if we really wana enlarge it,maybe we need a new kind of model structure,In order to record Status's relative location when the Model try to link those Status,as what the LLM have done through Word Embedding. Imagine that we got several images,through training,use like VAE structure,we can concentrate these images onto one image,and meanwhile,if this new image can be rebuild to these original images,then we can consider the new image actually carrys a new Status that contains the information about these series of images. Same question,if here we need some words to describe it,actually what we real need is a picture contains these words. This picture is trained from the picture belong to next level,if we try to continuous rebuild these pictures from level to level,finally,we'll get a picture that just contain one single word or char.（actually it's more like a tree structure.)

From the whole process about recovering the picture,we need two kinds of VAE Model. One kind in charge of rebuiding the images approximately,because in this process we can't  avoid missing part of the information,so it can just be rebuilt more similar as we can. Another kind of type,opposite with it,should pay more attention to recover the datails,it in charge of the process that to make the faint images more clearly even beyond it's original version, so it can work more perfectly while be used in Object identification or Target location. Imagine there exit one Robot,as we mentioned before,every moving,every time when it grab something all focus one kinds of Status,and the codes that used to order the drivers can be seemed as some kind of Status that paralleled with it. So when it start to move or do some homework,in order to figure out the whole process, the first kind of model will try to find the best way to link different Status  according to the relationship between them. We also know that we need detail action orders to rule the Robot,thus in the process about linking these Status,these order information that paralleled with visual status finally will be recover as single codes,and be used to move the drivers.

Of course,right here there's exit several points need us to pay more attention,first, about the degree that the images should be rebuild to,it need a balance. On the one hand,it need relatively vague,and this can guarantee that when the Model load it ,it won't be seemed as a new Status.  Because visual information really update too quick,so what we need is try to find a Status that relatively vague so as to stand for more similar events. On the other hand,for everytime while we concentrate or rebuild the images,there's must missing some part of information,thus there must exit some limits through these loops. Once the rebuilt information can't reach the point that we need,that also means the process about concentrating Status got the limits. Of course, although in this process all kinds of status all be changed as visual information,but still there's exit big difference when we try to concentrate different kinds of Status. For instance,the limits that when we concentrate Words maybe grossly larger than concentrating ordinary scenery.
